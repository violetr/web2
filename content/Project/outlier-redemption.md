[Outlier redemption](https://outlier-redemption.netlify.app) is a site/newsletter created to redeem outliers. During my PhD, I worked with Clustering methods. I spended a lot of time studying methods that ignore outliers. But in my spare time, I realized that outliers were indeed interesting, that it's worth paying attention to them. Outliers are like the fun facts of the data, and fun facts, even if they are usually useless, are fun. Then, this site is usually about giving (useless) insights into (trashy) data. Nevertheless, itâ€™s sometimes about random/surprising facts coming from totally meaningful data.

If you subscribe to the newsletter, you will receive twice a month a data-driven short story about an outlier. Why would you want this? For example, you can use this small piece of info to start a conversation with your colleagues.
