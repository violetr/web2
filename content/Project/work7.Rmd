In this document I present my analysis of the "Health, Nutrition and Population Statistics" dataset hosted by the World Bank Group. It was compiled from an RMarkdown file `datathon2019.Rmd`. A Shiny App showing the discussed topic and other visualizations can be accessed here. It's a complementary material but it doesn't replace this report. All the code that I used to build both the document and the application is available in this repository: github.com/violetr/health.

I analyzed the prevalence of HIV, paying special attention to risk areas. The results show good news regarding HIV control. It was also interesting to monitor the related indicators like knowledge about the virus and the progress regarding safe practices.  

## Introduction

Let's get some information from Wikipedia about HIV/AIDS:

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As the infection progresses, it affects more the immune system, increasing the risk of developing infections. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the virus subtype. HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex, contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Safe practices include safe sex (using condom), needle exchange programs, treating mothers that are infected, and male circumcision.

## Importing and tidying the data: considerations

First of all I had to import the data, I did this with the `readr` package. I chose to use the `tidyverse` environment instead of the `data.table` package because the computational needs were not too big and code is more readable with `dplyr`. Like that, don't need to comment a lot the tidy scripts. 

<style>
.html-widget {
    margin: auto;
}
</style>


```{r read, eval=FALSE,  warning=FALSE,  message= FALSE}
countries_hnp <- read_csv(here::here("data_health", "HNP_StatsCountry.csv"))

dataset_hnp <- read_csv(here::here("data_health", "HNP_StatsData.csv")) %>%
  select(-X63)

indicators_hnp <- read_csv(here::here("data_health", "HNP_StatsSeries.csv"))
```

I manipulated the data with `dplyr` and `tidyr` to select the columns of interest for the analysis and to reshape the data into a tidy format. I show the main part of the manipulation whose most important part is the gather-spread that returns a database where indicators are the columns:

```{r , eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, message= FALSE}
# select relevant variables and rename variables

# INDICATORS
indicators_hnp_keep <- indicators_hnp %>%
  select(`Series Code`, `Topic`, `Indicator Name`, `Long definition`)

# I change the names because I like it better without spaces
colnames(indicators_hnp_keep) <- colnames(indicators_hnp_keep) %>%
  str_to_lower() %>%
  str_replace(" ", "_")

# extract first part of the topic to have more general clasification
split_topic <- str_split(indicators_hnp_keep$topic, pattern = ":")

indicators_hnp_keep <- indicators_hnp_keep %>%
  mutate(
    gen_topic = map_chr(split_topic, ~ .x[1]), # general topic
    part_topic = map_chr(split_topic,~ .x[2])  # particular topic
  ) 

# COUNTRIES
countries_hnp_keep <- countries_hnp %>%
  select(`Country Code`, `Short Name`, `Table Name`, `Long Name`, `2-alpha code`, `Currency Unit`, Region, `Income Group`, `Lending category`, `Government Accounting concept`)

colnames(countries_hnp_keep) <- colnames(countries_hnp_keep) %>%
  str_to_lower() %>%
  str_replace(" ", "_")

# DATASET
colnames(dataset_hnp)[1:4] <- colnames(dataset_hnp)[1:4] %>%
  str_to_lower() %>%
  str_replace(" ", "_")
```

```{r tidy, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE}
# in dataset we have grouped countries
# by region, by income, etc
# also in countries dataset
real_countries <- countries_hnp_keep %>%
  filter(!is.na(currency_unit)) %>% # I filter them because they have NA currency
  pull(table_name)

dataset_hnp_health <- dataset_hnp %>%
  left_join(indicators_hnp_keep, by = c("indicator_code" = "series_code")) %>%
  select(-topic, -indicator_name.x, -indicator_name.y, -long_definition, -part_topic) %>%
  filter(
    gen_topic == "Health", 
    country_name %in% real_countries
  ) %>%
  gather(key = year, value = indicator_value, `1960`:`2017`) %>%
  spread(key = indicator_code, value = indicator_value) %>% # indicators as columns
  left_join(countries_hnp_keep, by = c("country_code" = "country_code")) %>% # get the region
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

```{r , eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, message= FALSE}
# Save the tidy datasets
write_feather(dataset_hnp, here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_exp"))
write_feather(dataset_hnp_health, here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_health_exp"))
write_feather(dataset_hnp_education,here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_education_exp"))
write_feather(indicators_hnp_keep, here::here("data_health", "indicators_hnp_exp"))
write_feather(countries_hnp_keep, here::here("data_health", "countries_hnp_exp"))
write_feather(dataset_hnp_others, here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_others_exp"))
```

For some analyses I used the `naniar` package to visualize the presence of missing data because of the big amount of missing data for some indicators, countries and periods of time. I also used `missMDA` to impute missing values with the PCA method in some parts.

```{r load tidy, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load the tidy data once it has been created
# to be faster

dataset_hnp <- read_feather(here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_exp"))
dataset_hnp_health <- read_feather(here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_health_exp"))
dataset_hnp_education <- read_feather(here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_education_exp"))
dataset_hnp_others <- read_feather(here::here("data_health", "dataset_hnp_others_exp"))
indicators_hnp_keep <- read_feather(here::here("data_health", "indicators_hnp_exp"))
countries_hnp_keep <- read_feather(here::here("data_health", "countries_hnp_exp"))

real_countries <- countries_hnp_keep %>% # real countries are not aggregations
  filter(!is.na(currency_unit)) %>% # I identify them because they don't
  pull(table_name) # have currency unit
```

This is a table including all the available indicators that are directly related with the virus and the syndrome:

<br>

```{r table indicators, results="asis"}
indicators_hnp_keep %>%
  filter(str_detect(indicator_name, "AIDS") | str_detect(indicator_name, "HIV") |
    str_detect(indicator_name, "Condom")) %>%
  select(indicator_name, series_code) %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

<br>

There are also other less directly related indicators like general education and access to the health system.

```{r get info, results="asis", echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# this chunck is only to get info

indicators_hnp_keep %>% # get particular topics
  pull(part_topic) %>%
  unique()

indicators_hnp_keep %>%
  filter(part_topic == " Disease prevention") %>%
  select(indicator_name, series_code)

indicators_hnp_keep %>%
  select(indicator_name, series_code)
```

## Affected population and progression

### How many people are living with HIV? How has this number evolved in the last 20 years?

Looking at the following plot showing the number of people in the world living with HIV can be really alarming:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# decimal format: (not scientific)
point <- format_format(big.mark = "", decimal.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
```
```{r people hiv line, fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.TOTL) %>%
  filter(year >= 1997) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(aids = sum(SH.HIV.TOTL, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # sum from all countries
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(image_aids = "aids2.png") %>% # add image for each point
  ggplot(aes(year, aids)) +
  geom_image(aes(image = image_aids), size=.05) + # geom from ggimage package
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("# of people") +
  ggtitle("Number of people in the world infected with HIV") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "# of people", labels = point)
```

Infected population has been continuously growing in the last 20 years. But this other one looks much better:

```{r deaths and new infections, echo=FALSE}
data_new_inf_deaths <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.INCD, SH.DYN.AIDS.DH) %>%
  filter(year >= 1997) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    aids.new = sum(SH.HIV.INCD, na.rm = TRUE), # new infections
    aids.deaths = sum(SH.DYN.AIDS.DH, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% # number of deaths
  ungroup() %>%
  select(year, aids.new, aids.deaths)
```

```{r , echo=FALSE}
data_new_inf_deaths %>%
  gather(aids.new, aids.deaths, key = "indicator", value = "value") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(year, value, color = indicator), size = 0.8) +
  ggtitle("Number of new HIV infections and deaths related with AIDS") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("# of people") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017)) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("AIDS-related deaths", "New infected")) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

The number of new infections is decreasing and the number of deaths related with AIDS is also decreasing since 2005. In a sense the first graph shows good news, because infected population is living more years. 

Let's see an analysis by country.

### Which countries are the most affected?

Let's look at the percent of population living with HIV in 2017:

```{r table countries, echo=FALSE}
dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.TOTL, SP.POP.TOTL) %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>% # currently
  mutate(aids.prop = SH.HIV.TOTL / SP.POP.TOTL * 100) %>% # percent
  filter(!is.na(aids.prop)) %>%
  select(country_name, aids.prop) %>%
  arrange(desc(aids.prop)) %>%
  head(10)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
by_risk <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.TOTL, SP.POP.TOTL) %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  mutate(aids.prop = SH.HIV.TOTL / SP.POP.TOTL * 100) %>%
  filter(!is.na(aids.prop)) %>%
  select(country_name, aids.prop) %>%
  arrange(desc(aids.prop)) %>%
  pull(country_name)

high_risk <- by_risk[1:20] # high risk countries
```

Africa has been the most affected continent. It's even clearer when we look the following interactive choropleth generated with `leaflet`:

```{r choropleth hiv, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
aids_countries <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_code, year, SH.HIV.TOTL, SP.POP.TOTL) %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  mutate(proportion_aids = SH.HIV.TOTL / SP.POP.TOTL * 100) %>%
  filter(!is.na(proportion_aids)) %>%
  select(-year)

# load world map
# countries_geo <- geojsonio::geojson_read(here::here("app_hnp","www", "countries.geojson"), what = "sp")

# simplify it because too heavy to shiny
# countries_simple <- rmapshaper::ms_simplify(countries_geo, keep = 0.05, keep_shapes = TRUE)

# saveRDS(countries_simple, file = "app_hnp/data/countries_simple.rds")
# I load the simplified version to be faster
countries_geo <- readRDS(here::here("data_health",  "countries_simple.rds"))

# join with aids
countries_geo@data <- countries_geo@data %>%
  left_join(aids_countries, by = c("ISO_A3" = "country_code")) %>%
  select(ADMIN, ISO_A3, proportion_aids)

# palette
binpal <- colorBin("Reds", countries_geo$proportion_aids, 9, pretty = FALSE)

# interactive labels
labels_geo_year <-
  paste0(
    "<strong>", countries_geo$ADMIN, "</strong>",
    ifelse(is.na(countries_geo$proportion_aids),
      "",
      paste0(
        "<br/>",
        round(countries_geo$proportion_aids, 4),
        "%"
      )
    )
  ) %>%
  lapply(htmltools::HTML) # because of html syntax

# plot interactive map
leaflet(data = countries_geo) %>%
  setView(35, 37.8, 1.4) %>%
  addProviderTiles("MapBox", options = providerTileOptions(
    id = "mapbox.light",
    accessToken = Sys.getenv("MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN")
  )) %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~ binpal(proportion_aids),
    weight = 2,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    dashArray = "2",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 2,
      color = "#999",
      dashArray = "",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      bringToFront = TRUE
    ),
    label = labels_geo_year,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto"
    )
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    pal = binpal,
    values = ~ (countries_geo$proportion_aids),
    opacity = 0.7,
    title = "% living with HIV",
    position = "bottomright",
    na.label = "No data"
  )
```
<br>

The most affected area is in particular the South of Africa, with countries from the North of Africa with one of the lowest HIV-infection shares. 

The Shiny App can be used to explore the choropleth for different HIV indicators and years.

### How are countries grouped based on HIV indicators?

Let's see how countries are grouped depending only on HIV related features. In order to do this I only considered the commensurable features, that is, relative values like percent or rates. Firstly, I embedded the dataset to 2D having into account HIV related features. Like that, I could visualize how countries group and see how clusters are related to the geographical location. I had to impute some missing values with the `missMDA` package prior to the embedding transformation.

UMAP is a new (2018) embedding algorithm that has a similar scheme to t-SNE, the well-known state of the art non-linear embedding algorithm. Their objective is to visualize high-dimensional datasets in 2D or 3D preserving neighborhoods in terms of distances. I decided to use it because it's much faster than t-SNE and all algorithm decisions are mathematically justified.

Let's see the resulting embedding for 2015:

```{r function, echo=FALSE}
# setting umap options for reproducibility
# defining function that select hiv related indicators and compute NA

custom.config <- umap.defaults
custom.config$random_state <- 44
custom.config$min_dist <- 0.1

data_to_embed <- function(indicators_hnp_keep, dataset_hnp_health, an_year, custom.config) {
    
  # I keep comparable indicators (%) HIV related
  comparable_health_indicators <- indicators_hnp_keep %>%
    filter(
      (str_detect(indicator_name, "%") | str_detect(indicator_name, "rate")) & (str_detect(indicator_name, "AIDS") | str_detect(indicator_name, "HIV") |
        str_detect(indicator_name, "Condom")),
      !part_topic %in% " Population"
    ) %>%
    pull(series_code)
  
  dataset_comparable_health <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
    filter(year == an_year) %>%
    select(country_name, country_code, region, one_of(comparable_health_indicators)) %>%
    select_if(function(x) (sum(is.na(x)) <= (0.4 * length(x))) || is.character(x))
  
  # I impute missing data
  res.comp <- imputePCA(as.data.frame(dataset_comparable_health[, 4:ncol(dataset_comparable_health)]))
  dataset_comparable_health_com <- res.comp$comp
  
  data_to_umap <- as.matrix(dataset_comparable_health_com)
  return(list(data_to_umap=data_to_umap, dataset_comparable_health = dataset_comparable_health))
}

```


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# UMAP embedding for a year in particular
an_year <- 2015

# keep only hiv related and percent or rate
comparable_health_indicators <- indicators_hnp_keep %>%
  filter(
    (str_detect(indicator_name, "%") | str_detect(indicator_name, "rate")) & (str_detect(indicator_name, "AIDS") | str_detect(indicator_name, "HIV") |
      str_detect(indicator_name, "Condom")), 
    !part_topic %in% " Population"
  ) %>%
  pull(series_code)

# subset the features already selected  
dataset_comparable_health <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  filter(year == an_year) %>%
  select(country_name, country_code, region, one_of(comparable_health_indicators)) %>%
  select_if(function(x) (sum(is.na(x)) <= (0.4 * length(x))) || is.character(x))
# only keep features that have a "resonable" amount of missing data

# I impute missing data
res.comp <- imputePCA(as.data.frame(dataset_comparable_health[, 4:ncol(dataset_comparable_health)])) #missMDA
dataset_comparable_health_com <- res.comp$comp
  
data_to_umap <- as.matrix(dataset_comparable_health_com)

#I apply the algorithm from the umap package
data_health_umap <- umap(data_to_umap, config = custom.config)
# and after that we plot it
```

```{r, echo =FALSE}
data_umap_health <- tibble(
  x = data_health_umap$layout[, 1],
  y = data_health_umap$layout[, 2],
  country = dataset_comparable_health$country_code,
  region = dataset_comparable_health$region
)
```
```{r, echo =FALSE}
data_umap_health %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = region, label = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), hjust = 0, vjust = 0, show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

We can visualize 6/7 clear groups, two of which are composed only by African countries (pink groups). These two African groups are the most affected countries. All the other clusters have an heterogeneous composition in terms of continents.

Secondly, I clustered the embedded data with the HDBSCAN density-based clustering algorithm from the `dbscan` library. 

```{r clustering, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# cluster countries from embedding representation
hiv_cl <- hdbscan(data_umap_health[, c(1, 2)], minPts = 6)$cluster

# add clusters to dataset
clt_to_map <- data_umap_health %>%
  select(country) %>%
  mutate(cstr = hiv_cl)
```

I plotted the resulting clustering encoded with colors in the world map:


```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
paleta <- rainbow_hcl(8, c = 35, l = 85)

factpal <- colorFactor(paleta, clt_to_map$cstr)

countries_geo <- readRDS(here::here("data_health",  "countries_simple.rds"))

countries_geo@data <- countries_geo@data %>%
  left_join(clt_to_map, by = c("ISO_A3" = "country")) %>%
  select(ADMIN, ISO_A3, cstr)

leaflet(data = countries_geo) %>%
  setView(0, 37.8, 1.3) %>%
  addProviderTiles("MapBox", options = providerTileOptions(
    id = "mapbox.light",
    accessToken = Sys.getenv("MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN")
  )) %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~ factpal(cstr),
    weight = 2,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    dashArray = "2",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 2,
      color = "#999",
      dashArray = "",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      bringToFront = TRUE
    ),
    label = countries_geo$ADMIN,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto"
    )
  )
```
<br>

Like this, we can see the clusters from the embedding but in a more tidy way. 

It's interesting to compare to the same visualization from 20 years before:

```{r embedding 2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
an_year <- 1995

res <- data_to_embed(indicators_hnp_keep, dataset_hnp_health, an_year,  custom.config)

data_to_umap <- res$data_to_umap 

dataset_comparable_health <- res$dataset_comparable_health

data_health_umap <- umap(data_to_umap, config = custom.config)

data_umap_health <- tibble(
  x = data_health_umap$layout[, 1],
  y = data_health_umap$layout[, 2],
  country = dataset_comparable_health$country_code,
  region = dataset_comparable_health$region
)

data_umap_health %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = region, label = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), hjust = 0, vjust = 0, show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

All sub-Saharan African countries were in the same group before. 

```{r clustering 2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hiv_cl <- hdbscan(data_umap_health[, c(1, 2)], minPts = 6)$cluster

clt_to_map <- data_umap_health %>%
  select(country) %>%
  mutate(cstr = hiv_cl)

factpal <- colorFactor(paleta, clt_to_map$cstr)

countries_geo <- readRDS(here::here("data_health", "countries_simple.rds"))

countries_geo@data <- countries_geo@data %>%
  left_join(clt_to_map, by = c("ISO_A3" = "country")) %>%
  select(ADMIN, ISO_A3, cstr)

leaflet(data = countries_geo) %>%
  setView(0, 37.8, 1.3) %>%
  addProviderTiles("MapBox", options = providerTileOptions(
    id = "mapbox.light",
    accessToken = Sys.getenv("MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN")
  )) %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~ factpal(cstr),
    weight = 2,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    dashArray = "2",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 2,
      color = "#999",
      dashArray = "",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      bringToFront = TRUE
    ),
    label = countries_geo$ADMIN,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto"
    )
  )
```

The shiny app can be used to explore how these plots change for different years.

## Treatment, education and safe practices

The objective of this section is to monitor indicators that are directly related to the prevalence of HIV virus as the coverage of treatment: knowledge about the virus and the safe practices that act as prevent methods. Ideally we could validate the prevalence and incidence indicators with the evolution of these other indicators.

### ART treatment

Antiretroviral treatment is the main therapy to fight the HIV infection. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. 

Some information about Antiretroviral treatment (ART) from avert.org:

> ART works by keeping the level of HIV in your body low (your viral load). This lets your immune system recover and stay strong. Keeping your viral load low also helps to prevent HIV being passed on.

This means that the treatment positively affects non-only the number of AIDS-related deaths, but it also decreases the new infections.

```{r art percent, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# the percentage of all people living with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy

dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.ARTC.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(year >= 1997, str_detect(region, "Africa")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(aids = mean(SH.HIV.ARTC.ZS, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(image_pill="pill.png") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, aids)) +
  geom_image(aes(image = image_pill), size=.05) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Percent of HIV infected people") +
  ggtitle("People living with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017))
```

The increasing slope of the plot indicates that every year the good treatment coverage is increasing. Good news.

There is an important aspect to take care about: the health of pregnant women. Some information about the Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT): 

> PMTCT programmes provide a range of services to women and infants. These include preventing HIV infections among women of reproductive age (15–49 years), preventing unwanted pregnancies among women living with HIV, and providing women living with HIV with lifelong ART to maintain their health and prevent transmission during pregnancy, labour and breastfeeding. PMTCT programmes also support safe childbirth practices and appropriate infant feeding, as well as providing infants exposed to HIV with virological testing after birth and during the breastfeeding period, ART for prevention and effective treatment. These actions can reduce the risk from 45% to below 5%.

Let's look how the PMTCT coverage in Africa evolves:

```{r PMTC, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.PMTC.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(year >= 1997, str_detect(region, "Africa")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(aids = mean(SH.HIV.PMTC.ZS, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, aids, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.8) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Percent of pregnant women with HIV") +
  ggtitle("Antiretroviral therapy coverage for PMTCT ") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2007, 2012, 2017), limits = c(2007, 2017))
```

We can also visualize that mother treatment coverage is increasing since we start to have values. Let's see how new children infections evolve:

```{r childen, echo = FALSE}
dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.INCD.14) %>%
  filter(year >= 1997) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(aids = sum(SH.HIV.INCD.14, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # sum from all countries
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, aids, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(size=.8) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("# of children") +
  ggtitle("Children (ages 0-14) newly infected with HIV") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "# of people", labels = point)
```
We can see that the closest in time the steeper the slope.  

### Knowledge about HIV

Of course education, and in particular HIV knowledge is highly related with the spread of the virus.

From Wikipedia: AIDS stigma exists around the world and it prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV. 

This is the why it is so important to provide good information to the people so that they know the actual methods of prevention and stop discriminating people living with HIV.

Let's look at the percent of population that has reasonable knowledge about HIV. In this case, a person is considered to have knowledge about HIV if they correctly identify the two major ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV (using condoms and limiting sex to one faithful, uninfected partner), reject the two most common local misconceptions about HIV transmission, and know that a healthy-looking person can have HIV.

Even though this particular feature is really interesting, it was too difficult to analyze because of the huge proportion of missing values:

```{r knowledge missing, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8}
dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(year >= 1997, str_detect(region, "Africa")) %>%
  vis_miss() # a lot of missing data
```

As I encountered difficulties because of of the missing data, I decided to plot the evolution of the variable for some of the countries from the risk area that had the biggest amount of measures:

```{r knowledge, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
# countries that have biggest number measures in the period
more_info <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(
    year >= 1997,
    str_detect(region, "Africa"),
    !is.na(SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS)
  ) %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(count = dplyr::n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  pull(country_name)

# countries more appereances in high risk (hightest HIV %)
# females
g_kn_fe <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(
    year >= 1997,
    str_detect(region, "Africa"),
    !is.na(SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS),
    country_name %in% more_info[1:8],
    country_name %in% high_risk
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS, color = country_name, group = country_name)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.3) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Percent of females") +
  ggtitle("HIV knowledge") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1997, 2002, 2007, 2013, 2017), limits = c(1997, 2017)) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  ylim(10, 65)

```
I did the same for males and then plot them together:
```{r , echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# countries more appereances in high risk (hightest HIV %)
# males
g_kn_ma <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS, SH.HIV.KNOW.MA.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(
    year >= 1997,
    str_detect(region, "Africa"),
    !is.na(SH.HIV.KNOW.FE.ZS),
    country_name %in% more_info[1:8],
    country_name %in% high_risk
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, SH.HIV.KNOW.MA.ZS, color = country_name, group = country_name)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.3) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Percent of males") +
  ggtitle("") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1997, 2002, 2007, 2013, 2017), limits = c(1997, 2017)) +
  ylim(10, 65)
```
```{r , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# patchwork package:
g_kn_fe + g_kn_ma 
```

Looking at both charts I couldn't affirm much about this indicator.

### Use of condom

As I mentioned in the introduction the methods to prevent HIV infection are safe sex, not sharing needles and male circumcision. From all these prevention actions we have access to the safe sex practice indicator. This indicator measure the percent of the population (ages 15-49) who used a condom at last intercourse with a non-marital and non-cohabiting sexual partner in the last 12 months.  Let's see these indicator by gender:

```{r condom, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8}
more_info <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.CON.AIDS.FE.ZS, SH.CON.1524.FE.ZS, SH.CON.1524.FE.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(
    year >= 1997,
    str_detect(region, "Africa"),
    !is.na(SH.CON.AIDS.FE.ZS)
  ) %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(count = dplyr::n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  pull(country_name)

g_fe <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year, SH.CON.AIDS.FE.ZS, SH.CON.1524.FE.ZS, SH.CON.1524.FE.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(
    year >= 1997,
    str_detect(region, "Africa"),
    !is.na(SH.CON.AIDS.FE.ZS),
    country_name %in% more_info[1:8],
    country_name %in% high_risk
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, SH.CON.AIDS.FE.ZS, color = country_name, group = country_name)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.3) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Percent of females") +
  ggtitle("Condom use at last high-risk sex") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1998, 2003, 2007, 2012, 2016), limits = c(1997, 2017)) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  ylim(15, 80)

g_ma <- dataset_hnp_health %>%
  select(country_name, year,SH.CON.AIDS.MA.ZS, SH.CON.AIDS.FE.ZS, SH.CON.1524.FE.ZS, SH.CON.1524.FE.ZS, region) %>%
  filter(
    year >= 1997,
    str_detect(region, "Africa"),
    !is.na(SH.CON.AIDS.FE.ZS),
    country_name %in% more_info[1:8],
    country_name %in% high_risk
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, SH.CON.AIDS.MA.ZS, color = country_name, group = country_name)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.3) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Percent of males") +
  ggtitle("") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1998, 2003, 2007, 2012, 2016), limits = c(1997, 2017)) +
  ylim(15, 80)

g_fe+g_ma
```

We observe an increasement in the percent for both available gender information. It is also important to notice that male values are in general much bigger than female values.

## Conclusions

In this document we studied in general the prevalence of HIV in the world. We found that the number of new infections has been decreasing in the last 20 years. Also, the number of AIDS-related deaths did decrease since 2004. We realized that the most affected area is the South of Africa and realized that the north of Africa has one of the lowest prevalence of the virus of the world. 

Regarding treatment, all plots show that the coverage percent of ART has increased. We couldn't say much about the evolution of the knowledge about HIV because of the big proportion of missing data, but it seems to be increasing in the long term. Finally, we had good news about safe practices: the use of condom has been increasing during the studied period. The behavior of these features over the time is compatible with the prevalence evolution and it validates the strong correlation that they have.
