I created a [Quiz](https://quiz.directory/quiz/u90G4z8M) about Data Visualization literacy for the [Telegram Quiz Contest](https://telegram.org/blog/400-million). During the quiz, one has to decide whether the plots are correct or not, and why. This is an example of question:

And, all plots are COVID-19 related. For the media, I drew sketches of graphs that appeared on TV and newspapers.

I got a Silver prize and received 100 euros :)! Try it out if you have a Telegram account!
