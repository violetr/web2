I try to collaborate with [MetaDocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/) either being TA or analysing their data.

MetaDocencia is a non-profit organization that nurtures a community of Spanish-speaking educators by teaching concrete, evidence-based, and student-centered educational methods. We collaboratively develop open, reusable, and accessible resources to foster effective training practices.

MetaDocencia started in 2020 are is centered in giving workshops about how to efficiently improve your courses.
