This is the first Shiny App I developed and also my first #TidyTuesday submission.

I show the participation of twitter users to the hashtag #TidyTuesday with an interactive Github Heatmap I created with plotly.

You can find the app here: https://violetr.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdaytweets/. 

You can find the code to generate it here: https://github.com/violetr/tidytuesday/tree/master/2019_01_01_shiny.
