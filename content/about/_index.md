Hi! I'm Violeta, currently a Ph.D. candidate  studying clustering methods in a joint program between Universidad de Buenos Aires and CentraleSup√©lec. Before, I've finished my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics with a final project on undirected Graphical Models at Universidad de Buenos Aires. I'm interested in Data Visualization, Data Art, Creative Coding and Machine Learning. Also in tea, art in general, feminism and eco activism.
