Hi! I'm Violeta, currently a freelance Data Scientist. I've just finished my PhD in Mathematics in a joint program between [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (Université Paris-Saclay) and [Givaudan](https://www.givaudan.com/), a company that creates fragrances. Before, I got my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics with a final project on undirected Graphical Models from [Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://exactas.uba.ar/). I'm interested in Data Visualization, Data Art, Creative Coding and Machine Learning. Also in tea, art in general, feminism and eco activism. I am certified as a [tidyverse instructor by RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) and would be happy to set up a workshop (in Spanish or English) for your company or institution.
